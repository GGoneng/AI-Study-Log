Follower of Christ, lover of programming, and musician. God blessed me and I know how to play on musical instruments and code, I thank God that he blesses me in all I do. I love that he protects me from any danger or anything that might harm. I would be insanely happy if everyone on Kaggle believes in his magnificient name, he wants that, because he doesn't want people to die in hell, but he wants everybody to live in heaven with him forever. But sin is a problem, as it is written
"For all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God." Romans 3:23
And also,
"For the wages of sin, is death, but the gift of God, eternal life in Jesus Christ, our Lord." Romans 6:23
You might ask, "Why should God be doing all this for us?" Well the answer is:
"For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him, won't perish, but will have eternal life." John 3:16
He loved us, those who sin against his name and blaspheme his holy dwelling. He gives everybody the way to life, through faith in Jesus Christ, as it is written:
"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." Acts 4:12
So I hope that you who are reading this, will believe, and when the last days come, and when we will be taken of this earth, we will meet in heaven and praise our Savior, Jesus Christ.

Hello colleagues!
My name is Ryzhkov Alexander and I'm the head of LightAutoML group.
At the end of 2020 we opensourced our LightAutoML python library aimed at Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). It is designed to be lightweight and efficient for various tasks (binary/multiclass classifcation and regression) on tabular datasets which contains different types of features: numeric, categorical, dates, texts etc.
LightAutoML installation is pretty simple - pip install -U lightautoml
Official LightAutoML documentation
LightAutoML provides not only presets suite for end-to-end ML tasks solving, but also the easy-to-use ML pipeline creation constructor including data preprocessing elements, advanced feature generation, CV schemes (including nested CVs), hyperparameters tuning, different models and composition building methods. It also gives the user an option to generate model training and profiling reports to check model results and find insights which are not obvious from initial dataset.
